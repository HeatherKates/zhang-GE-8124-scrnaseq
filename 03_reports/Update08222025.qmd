## Project Status: Processing and preliminary analysis 95% complete

**Completed Analyses (3/4):**

-   **AL (Aged Lymph Node)** - Complete, excellent QC
-   **YT (Young Tumor)** - Complete, excellent QC, one sample failed (n=2 Vehicle)
-   **AT (Aged Tumor)** - Complete, excellent QC\
-   **YL (Young Lymph Node)** - Pending

## Data Quality Highlights

-   Exceptional mitochondrial percentages (2-4% across all samples)
-   Strong VDJ integration (50-70% BCR+, 30-50% TCR+)
-   Clear treatment effects detected across multiple cell populations
-   No batch effects - excellent sample integration

## Key Findings So Far

-   Germinal center B cells depleted by treatment in aged lymph node tissue
-   Broad immune effects (most populations expand with treatment)
-   Consistent patterns emerging across age/tissue conditions

## Next Steps

-   Complete YL (Young Lymph Node) processing
-   Share individual reports for Temi/Zhang review (visit [Project Tracking](https://bcb-sr.rc.ufl.edu/projecttracking/) login: Zhangw pw: pass3 and download Reports)
-   Annotate cells based on cell type marker plots in report or other
-   Plan integrated comparative analysis based on feedback
